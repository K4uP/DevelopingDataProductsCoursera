About the Course Developing Data Products

A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. The course will focus on the statistical fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience.


This application is a project for Coursera Developing Data Products.
I admit that this app has no practical use. It only shows to my skills with R and Shiny.
