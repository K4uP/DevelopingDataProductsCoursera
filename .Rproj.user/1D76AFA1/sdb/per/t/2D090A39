Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. The course will focus on the statistical fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience.\n\n\nThis application is a project for Coursera Developing Data Products.\nI admit that this app has no practical use. It only shows to my skills with R and Shiny.\n\n\n\n--- .class #id\n\n### Why this App?\n\nThis application is a project for Coursera Developing Data Products.\nI admit that this app has no practical use.
